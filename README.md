You've stumbled upon Hack Club's website.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.0+ with Rails

### Install dependencies

After cloning the repo:

    $ bundle install

### Database migrations

    $ rake db:migrate

### Secrets

Secret keys are handled with [Figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro).
Create `config/application.yml` containing the following keys and 
corresponding values.

- `SECRET_KEY_BASE`
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Publishable key for [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Secret key for [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` - JavaScript API key for Google Maps

#### Production Secrets

The following secrets are also required for production.

- `SMTP_ADDRESS`
- `SMTP_PORT`
- `SMTP_USERNAME`
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`
- `SMTP_DOMAIN`

#### Optional Variables

- `REFERRERS_TO_BLOCK`
  - A list of regular expressions of hostnames to block, separated by `|`. This
    is used to prevent
    [referrer spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referer_spam)
    - Examples: `.*\.spam\.com|\w+.spamwow.\w+`, `bad\.referrer\.com`

### Start server

    $ rails serve

The website should now be running on your computer at http://localhost:3000.

## Deployment

If you choose to use the `Procfile` for deployment, you _must_ set the
following environment variables to appropriate values:

- `PORT`
- `RACK_ENV`
